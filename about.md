I work as a Senior Software Developer at Walmart Labs where I develop services to ease the lives of Walmart Store Associates across the world. Prior to this, I was a Developer Associate at SAP Labs India where I worked on development of microservices for management of test data across various S4 systems. I was also responsible for development of intelligent solutions for quality assurance. 

My core interests lie in understanding the impact of technology on humans and vice-versa. Specifically, I like to understand how technology, existing and developing, can broaden the existing cultural and societal gaps in the society and how we can mitigate the same. Language has and will, I believe, play a very important role in helping us understand the society better and thus I am keenly interested in Natural Language Processing as a field.

Some of my past works around bias and fainess and using human interactions on social media to analyse the user behavior has been published in conferences like NeurIPS. I also co-founded a startup TAFLE where which focused on enabling circular economy by bringing recyclers, collection partners and manufacturers on the same platform. The idea was amongst one of the 5 finalists at SAP 1 Billion Lives APJ round.

I like to put my brain to work by solving puzzles, playing chess and occassionally spending my time on <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/users/thechange"> codechef</a>. I've realized I am my truest self when I am cocooned in the blanket of emotions that overwhelm me when I am <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51522882-shanya-sharma">reading</a>, <a href = "/poetry_essay/poetry/">writing</a> or watching animes!!!
