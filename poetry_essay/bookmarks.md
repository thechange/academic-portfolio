The magic of books is in the way words arrange themselves and take us to a different place, sometimes within ourselves. Places, that likely escaped our vision all this time but a line, maybe just a word changed the way we see. Here is a collection of thse very lines, the ones I came across and could never let go of.

### Homegoing - Yaa Gyasi
* No one forgets that they were once captive, even if they are now free.
* Evil begets evil. It grows. It transmutes, so that sometimes you cannot see that the evil in the world began as the evil in your own home.
* Split the Castle open,
find me, find you.
We, two, felt sand,
wind, air.
One felt whip. Whipped,
Once shipped.
We, two, black.
Me, you.
One grew from
cocoa's soil, birthed from nut,
skin uncut, still bleeding.
We two, wade.
The waters seem different
but are same.
Our same. Sister skin.
Who knew? Not me. Not you
* You can learn anything when you have to learn it. You could learn how to fly if it meant you would live another day.
