<h1>Hi!</h1>
<br><br>Thanks for visiting!!
<br><br>I'm Shanya and this is where you can find information regarding my academic life. 
<br><br>
My research interests lie primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing, preferably its usage for social good. My ideal research project is one which uses technology to understand the society better and makes an impact for the social good.<br><br>
Currently I work as a Senior Software Developer at <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/walmartglobaltech">Walmart Labs India</a> where I am responsible for the development of backend services for Walmart store associates across the world. Prior to this I worked as a Developer Associate at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP">SAP Labs</a> and as a Research Intern at <a href = "https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/">IIIT Jabalpur</a> under the guidance of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/atulkg/"> Dr. Atul Gupta. </a><br><br>

Parallely, I have also been pursuing my research interests. You can find a list of my publications and other research projects under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab.

I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p> You can also find my detailed cv <a href = "/cv"> here</a><br> <br>
